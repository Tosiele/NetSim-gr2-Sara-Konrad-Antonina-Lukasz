The NetSim project is a C++ application that simulates a factory production line using a network of connected nodes. The main object moving through this system is the Package, which has a unique ID number and cannot be copied. The network consists of three specific types of nodes called Ramps, Workers, and Storehouses. Ramps act as sources that create new packages at specific time intervals defined by a delivery frequency. Workers receive these packages into a queue and process them for a set number of turns before sending them to the next station. Each Worker uses a specific buffering strategy, such as First-In-First-Out or Last-In-First-Out, to manage items while they are busy working on a current package. Storehouses act as the final destination where finished products are stored forever. The nodes connect using specific code interfaces like PackageSender and IPackageReceiver to ensure they can transfer items correctly. The simulation runs in discrete time units called rounds, and each round is strictly divided into three sequential stages. These stages are the delivery of products to ramps, the transfer of products between nodes, and the actual processing by workers. During these stages, the program updates elements one by one based on their ElementID to avoid technical conflicts. Before starting, the system must verify that the network is consistent so that every package has a valid path to a storehouse. Finally, the project includes a reporting system to save the state of the simulation and the structure of the network to a file.
